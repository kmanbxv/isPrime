# isPrime
a prime number learning game.
tap start to begin. a timer counts to five seconds, after which you will lose unless you can find the prime factors of the number that appears in the center. To do so, click on any factors that you see out of the choices given. If the number is prime, click the isprime button. Although there is a counter for the number of primes factorized, the score I chose to keep track of is the numerical value of each factor you find. for example, it is very easy to spot a factor of 2, so pressing the '2' button only gets you two points. Each factor f gives you f points, except 11, which gives five points because factors of 11 are also easy to spot. You will score higher, therefore, if you can spot the primes like 17 and 23, which are much harder, but will become easier as you play.

My high score: 336
